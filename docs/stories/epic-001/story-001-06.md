# Story 001-06: Move objects by dragging and numeric input

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Core Drawing and Editing Tools
**Status:** Not Started

## Description

As a pattern designer, I want to move objects by dragging or entering coordinates
so that I can position pattern pieces precisely.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can drag selected objects with mouse (traditional click-drag-release)
- [ ] Dragging shows real-time visual feedback (object moves with cursor)
- [ ] User can enter precise X, Y coordinates in Properties Panel
- [ ] Numeric input moves object to absolute position
- [ ] Move respects grid snapping if enabled
- [ ] Move operation is undoable (single undo step for entire move)
- [ ] Multi-object move maintains relative positions between objects
- [ ] Drag works smoothly (60fps performance)

---

## Technical Notes

- Implement drag handling in QGraphicsItem (already has built-in support)
- Enable item dragging: setFlag(QGraphicsItem::ItemIsMovable)
- Create MoveObjectsCommand for undo/redo
- Override itemChange() to capture position changes
- Add numeric position input to Properties Panel (connects to story-001-05)
- Handle snapping in move operations (check grid snap setting)
- For multi-object move, calculate relative offsets and maintain them
- Batch moves into single undo command

**Drag Implementation:**
```cpp
QVariant PatternItem::itemChange(GraphicsItemChange change, const QVariant &value) {
    if (change == ItemPositionChange && scene()) {
        QPointF newPos = value.toPointF();

        // Apply grid snapping if enabled
        if (gridSnapEnabled) {
            newPos = snapToGrid(newPos);
        }

        return newPos;
    }
    return QGraphicsItem::itemChange(change, value);
}
```

## Dependencies

- story-001-03: Selection system
- story-001-05: Properties panel with position editors
- story-008-08: Undo/redo system
- story-008-10: Grid and snapping (optional, can work without)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [ ] Drag and drop working smoothly
- [ ] Numeric input working
- [ ] Grid snapping integrated
- [ ] Undo/redo working
- [ ] Multi-object move maintains positions
- [ ] Unit tests for move command
- [ ] Integration tests for dragging
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Merged to main branch
