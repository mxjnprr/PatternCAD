**Status:** Not Started
**Estimate:** 3 points
**Assigned To:** Unassigned

## Description

As a pattern designer, I want to define layout sheets with specific dimensions
so that I can arrange pattern pieces on material for cutting.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can create layout sheet with width and height (with units)
- [ ] User can define multiple sheets within same project
- [ ] Layout sheet displays with visual boundary on canvas
- [ ] Sheet dimensions can be edited
- [ ] User can switch between sheets (tabs or dropdown)
- [ ] Sheets are saved with project

---

## Technical Notes

**LayoutSheet Class:**
```cpp
class LayoutSheet {
    QString name;
    double width;         // in project units
    double height;
    QColor backgroundColor;
    std::vector<Pattern*> placedPatterns;

    QRectF bounds() const {
        return QRectF(0, 0, width, height);
    }

    void render(QPainter& painter) {
        // Draw sheet boundary
        painter.setPen(QPen(Qt::black, 2));
        painter.setBrush(QBrush(backgroundColor));
        painter.drawRect(bounds());

        // Draw corner markers
        drawCornerMarkers(painter);
    }
};
```

**UI Integration:**
- Add "New Sheet" command to File menu or Sheet menu
- Dialog to create sheet:
  - Name input
  - Width and height inputs with unit selector
  - Background color selector
- Sheet switching: Tabs at top or dropdown in toolbar
- Current sheet highlighted in UI

**Sheet Management:**
- Project can contain multiple sheets
- Each sheet has independent pattern placement
- Same pattern can be placed on multiple sheets (instances)
