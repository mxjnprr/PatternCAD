## Description

As a pattern designer, I want to draw basic geometric shapes (lines, points, rectangles, circles)
so that I can create the foundation of my pattern pieces.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can select Line tool (L key) and draw lines by clicking start and end points
- [ ] User can select Point tool (P key) and place points at specific coordinates
- [ ] User can select Rectangle tool (R key) and create rectangles by defining opposite corners
- [ ] User can select Circle tool (C key) and draw circles by defining center and radius
- [ ] All shapes support numerical input for precise dimensions
- [ ] Shapes are visually rendered on canvas with clear appearance
- [ ] Created shapes are added to current active layer

---

## Technical Notes

- Implement Tool base class with activate(), deactivate(), mouse events
- Create LineTool, PointTool, RectangleTool, CircleTool subclasses
- Implement geometry primitives: Line, Point, Rectangle, Circle classes
- Add tools to tool palette
- Integrate with canvas mouse event handling
- Create QGraphicsItem subclasses for rendering each shape type
- Store geometry objects in Pattern/Layer data structures

---

## Dependencies

- Sprint 0: Project skeleton and Qt setup complete
- Main window and canvas implemented (story-008-01, story-008-02)

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests for tool interaction
- [ ] Shapes render correctly on canvas
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Merged to main branch
