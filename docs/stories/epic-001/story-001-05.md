**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Core Drawing and Editing Tools
**Status:** Not Started
**Estimate:** 5 points
**Assigned To:** Unassigned

## Description

As a pattern designer, I want to edit object properties like position, size, line weight, and color
so that I can precisely control the appearance of my pattern pieces.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Selected objects display properties in Properties Panel
- [ ] User can edit X, Y position with numeric input (with units mm/cm/inches)
- [ ] User can edit width, height for applicable objects (rectangles, etc.)
- [ ] User can edit line weight (thickness) from 0.1mm to 5mm
- [ ] User can edit line color using color picker dialog
- [ ] User can edit line style (solid, dashed, dotted)
- [ ] Property changes apply immediately to objects on canvas
- [ ] Property changes are undoable (single undo per property change)
- [ ] Multi-selection shows common properties or "Mixed" indicator
- [ ] Properties panel updates when selection changes

---

## Technical Notes

- Implement PropertiesPanel QDockWidget (already created in story-008-04)
- Create property editor widgets:
  - Position: QDoubleSpinBox with unit selector (mm/cm/inches)
  - Size: QDoubleSpinBox
  - Line weight: QDoubleSpinBox (0.1-5.0 range)
  - Color: QPushButton → QColorDialog
  - Line style: QComboBox (Solid, Dashed, Dotted)
- Connect property changes to UpdatePropertyCommand for undo/redo
- Implement property getter/setter on geometry objects
- Handle multi-selection: show "Mixed" if values differ
- Support unit conversion when changing unit system

**Property Update Flow:**
```
User edits property → UpdatePropertyCommand created →
Command executed → Object updated → Canvas re-renders →
Property change pushed to undo stack
```
