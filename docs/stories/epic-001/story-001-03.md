# Story 001-03: Select objects with click and marquee selection

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Core Drawing and Editing Tools
**Status:** Not Started
**Estimate:** 5 points
**Assigned To:** Unassigned

## Description

As a pattern designer, I want to select pattern pieces and objects by clicking or marquee selection
so that I can edit, move, or transform them.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can click on any object to select it (single selection)
- [ ] Selected objects show visual feedback (bounding box, handles, highlight)
- [ ] User can Shift+Click to add objects to selection (multi-selection)
- [ ] User can Ctrl+Click to toggle object in/out of selection
- [ ] User can marquee select by dragging a selection rectangle
- [ ] Marquee selection selects all objects intersecting the rectangle
- [ ] Ctrl+A selects all objects on canvas
- [ ] Escape deselects all objects
- [ ] Selection state persists across tool changes

---

## Technical Notes

- Implement SelectTool with rubber band selection (QRubberBand)
- Add selection state to geometry objects (bool selected flag)
- Create SelectionManager to track selected objects (QSet<GeometryObject*>)
- Implement visual selection feedback using QPen with different color/width
- Handle selection in QGraphicsView scene (item selection)
- Support both bounding box and shape-based selection
- Emit signals when selection changes for UI updates

**Key Classes:**
```cpp
class SelectionManager {
    QSet<PatternItem*> selectedItems;
    void select(PatternItem* item, bool addToSelection);
    void deselect(PatternItem* item);
    void clearSelection();
    void selectAll();
    QSet<PatternItem*> getSelection() const;
signals:
    void selectionChanged();
};
```
